# Explanations of Technology Used
The technologies I used were :

1. HTML5
  * I used HTML5 to structure my page and give it content.
2. CSS
  * I used CSS to add style to my page.
3. jQuery
  * I used jQuery to add logic to my page and make it "clickable." I chose to use jQuery instead of Vanilla Javascript because we had just learned jQuery in class and I wanted to continue to practice it

# Approach Taken
In order to complete my project, I used HTML5, CSS, and jQuery.

My main approach was to add click events to the characters and boxes since they are the main two components of my game.  

# User Stories

As a user I would like to be able to:
  * Pick the classmate I want to find
  * Track how many missed attempts I have had
  * Keep track of my wins
  * Reset the game when I want to
  * Experience a game without lags
  * Have clear instructions

# How to use
1. Player 1 choose a character to find
2. Click on boxes with the "?"s to try to find your character in the **least** amount of attempts possible
3. Once Player 1 finds character, switch to Player 2
4. Player 2 choose a character to find
5. Click on the boxes with the "?"s to try to find your character in the **least** amount of attempts
6. The winner will be the player who finds their character in the least amount of attempts
7. After the game ends, you will be prompted to answer whether or not you want to play again. Type "Y" in the prompt if you would like to play again, type "N" in the prompt if you would not like to play again.


# Unsolved Problems
* Once Player 1 finished their turn, Player 2 is notified that it is their turn in the right sidebar. The unsolved problem in this case is when a player chooses to continue, the sidebar does not notify them to go just like it did the first time.

* When the players are prompted whether or not they want to continue, if they enter "N" for no, the game does not reset!

* The player 1 and player 2 scores are not responsive.
